                <p> Since the start of my 4th grade class, the 5 paragraph essay has been the golden standard in
                    every
                    classroom.
                    We were taught a way of writing that helped us get our ideas across in a neat and organized
                    way. You
                    may be wondering
                    about the title and thinking, "What is this fool talking about?" Well to answer that
                    question, we
                    need to dive into what
                    makes a 5 paragraph essay.
                </p>

                <h2>What is the 5 paragraph essay?</h2>

                <p>
                    A 5 paragraph essay has 5 main parts:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li> Introduction </li>
                    <li> Body 1</li>
                    <li> Body 2 </li>
                    <li> Body 3</li>
                    <li>The Conclusion</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Introduction</h3>
                <p>
                    The introduction has an opening statement of attention getter. It's followed by a supporting
                    sentence which links the attention
                    getter to the thesis statement. The thesis statment tells the reader the pupose of the essay
                    and the
                    flow of the three main topics that
                    will be discussed.
                </p>
                <h3>Body Paragraphs</h3>
                <p>
                    There are 3 body paragraphs to explain your claim and ideas. The very first sentence is the
                    topic
                    sentence which tells you what that paragraph is about. This is
                    followed by sentences that support back up your claim or idea.
                </p>
                <h3>The Conclusion</h3>
                <p>
                    The conclusion is the final paragrpah that will summarize all of your main points and
                    re-assert your
                    claim. The main purpose of this is to top off your essay
                    and end with a pondering thought that makes your essay memorable.
                </p>

                <h2>Natural Evolution of Writing?</h2>
                <p>
                    It's time to talk about how the power of the 5 paragraph essay has dwindled as the
                    grades went by.
                    It was not until my high school years that the importance of the 5 paragraph
                    essay started to wane. Towards the end of my freshman English class, I remember that we
                    began to
                    go past 5 paragraphs. There are limits to what you could express in this form factor.
                    If you had more than three main points to write about, the format wasn't extensive
                    enough to put
                    everything you needed inside it. This was common when I had to write research papers
                    because 3 main points weren't enough to fill the page requirements. We fast forward to
                    my senior
                    year of high school in my creative writing English class. The idea of the 5 paragraph
                    has all but faded into obscurity. We learned to write as if telling a story. It allowed
                    us to
                    write to our hearts content without the boundaries of 5 paragraphs. It sometimes feels
                    as
                    if the limits of my writing had been let loose and has lead me to a stark thought that
                    this may
                    just be the natural evolution of writing. This is the point where we work up to as we
                    age.
                    The death of the five paragraph essay is the beginning of learning new writing genres
                    for which
                    we can express ourselves.
                </p>

                <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                <p id="space">
                    I hope you have enjoyed learning about what makes up a 5 paragraph essay, my thoughts
                    over the
                    importance it, and the use of the it.
                    To answer the title, no, the 5 paragraph isn't going anywhere, at least not for the
                    generation
                    to come.
